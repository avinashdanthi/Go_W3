# What is Go ?

a. Go is cross-platform, open source programming language
b. Go can be used to create high performance applications
c. Go is a fast, statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and efficiency.
d. Go was developed at Google by three members Robert,Rob and Kim in 2007
e. Go syntax is similar to C++

# What is Go used for ?

a. Web development (server-side)
b. Developing network-based programs
c. Developing cross-platform enterprise applications
d. cloud-native development

# Why use Go ?

a. Go has fast run time and compilation time
b. Go supports concurrency
c. Go has memory management (Go has garbage collection and automatic memory management, so you donâ€™t have to manually free memory.)
d. Go works on different platforms(Windows, Mac, lINUX, Raspberry Pi,etc.)

# Go syntax:

A go file consists of the following parts.
a. Package declaration
b. Import pacakages
c. Functions
d. Statements and expressions

# Go Variable Types

int, float_thirty_two, string, bool
In Go there are two ways to declare a variable:
1.with var keyword var variablename type = value 2. With the := sign variablename := value

# Go Constants

The const keyword declares the variable as "constant", which means that it is unchangeable and read only.
const CONSTNAME type = value
Constants follow the same naming convention as variables
Constants are of two types "typed" eg: const A int = 1 amd "untyped" eg: const A = 1

# Go Output functions

1. Print("Prints the raw format") 2. Println("Same as prinf but adds a new line at the end") 3.Printf("It formats its argument based on the given formatting verb")
   General Formatting verbs:
   %v - Prints the value in default format
   %#v - Prints the value in Go syntax format
   %T - Prints the type of the value
   %% - Prints the % sign

# Go Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
In Go there are two types of array declaration:
1.With the var keyword
var array_name = [length]datatype{values} // here length is defined
or
var array_name = [...]datatype{values} // here length is inferred 2. With the := sign
array_name := [length]datarype{values} // here the length is defined
or
array_name := [...]datatype{values} // here length is inferred

# Go Slices

Slices are similar to arrays, but more powerful and flexible
Like arrays, slices are also used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable.
However, unlike arrays, the length of a slice can grow and shrink as you see it.
In Go, there are several ways to create a slice:

1.  Using the []datatype{values}format
    2.Create slice from an array
    3.Using the make() function

mySlice=[]int // empty slice of 0 length and o capacity
mySlice=[]int{1,2,3} // slice of integers of length 3 and also the capacity of 3

In Go, there are two functions that can be used to return the length and capacity of a slice:
len() function: returns the length of the slice(the number of elements in the slice)
cap() function: returns the capacity of slice(the number of elements the slice can grow or shrink to)

Create a slice from an array:You create a slice by slicing an array:
var myarray = [length]datatype{values} // an array
mySlice := myarray[start:end] // A slice made from the array

Create a slice with the make() function
slice_name := make([]type,length,capacity)
Note : If the capacity parameter is not defined, it will be equal to length.

Modify slice : Access,Change,Append,Copy
slice_name[index] // Access
slice_name[index] = element
slice_name = append(slice_name, element1, element2,....)
