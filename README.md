# What is Go ?

a. Go is cross-platform, open source programming language
b. Go can be used to create high performance applications
c. Go is a fast, statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and efficiency.
d. Go was developed at Google by three members Robert,Rob and Kim in 2007
e. Go syntax is similar to C++

# What is Go used for ?

a. Web development (server-side)
b. Developing network-based programs
c. Developing cross-platform enterprise applications
d. cloud-native development

# Why use Go ?

a. Go has fast run time and compilation time
b. Go supports concurrency
c. Go has memory management (Go has garbage collection and automatic memory management, so you donâ€™t have to manually free memory.)
d. Go works on different platforms(Windows, Mac, lINUX, Raspberry Pi,etc.)

# Go syntax:

A go file consists of the following parts.
a. Package declaration
b. Import pacakages
c. Functions
d. Statements and expressions

# Go Variable Types

int, float_thirty_two, string, bool
In Go there are two ways to declare a variable:
1.with var keyword var variablename type = value 2. With the := sign variablename := value

# Go Constants

The const keyword declares the variable as "constant", which means that it is unchangeable and read only.
const CONSTNAME type = value
Constants follow the same naming convention as variables
Constants are of two types "typed" eg: const A int = 1 amd "untyped" eg: const A = 1

# Go Output functions

1. Print("Prints the raw format") 2. Println("Same as prinf but adds a new line at the end") 3.Printf("It formats its argument based on the given formatting verb")
   General Formatting verbs:
   %v - Prints the value in default format
   %#v - Prints the value in Go syntax format
   %T - Prints the type of the value
   %% - Prints the % sign

# Go Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
In Go there are two types of array declaration:
1.With the var keyword
var array_name = [length]datatype{values} // here length is defined
or
var array_name = [...]datatype{values} // here length is inferred 2. With the := sign
array_name := [length]datarype{values} // here the length is defined
or
array_name := [...]datatype{values} // here length is inferred
